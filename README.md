# Sea_battle 
#### <Version 1.1>

This is a classic sea battle game.
The game is designed for two players.

At the beginning of the game, each player places his own set of ships on the field, and after the players, starting from the first one, take turns shooting at the opponent's field. Whoever picks up all the ships wins.

The game will control the correct placement of ships, and will also keep score for you.
